# Stock_Market_Analysis
This project use Python and Jupyter Notebook to create a neural network program that predicts future stock prices

The dataset used in this project is imported data from Yahoo Finance. this project specifically uses data from the S&P 500, DOw Jones, NASDAQ, Russell 2000, and the NYSE Composite

This project compares the effectiveness of a Long short-term memory model with a recurrent neural network model using stock data and various data inputs. Each model will try to predict the next day's stock price using the previous 4 days' stock price and volume data. First, it compares each models' effectiveness using a central moving average as its input. Next it compares their effectiveness using sequences as its inputs. 

The table below shows the results of the project and each model's effectiveness
